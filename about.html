    <h1>About This Traffic Study Visualization</h1>

    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <div class="source">
        <p><strong>Study:</strong> University Park Traffic Calming Implementation Plan</p>
        <p><strong>Conducted by:</strong> Town of University Park, Maryland</p>
        <p><strong>Data Collection Date:</strong> Wednesday, April 23, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Time Periods:</strong> 6:00-10:00 AM and 3:00-7:00 PM</p>
        <p><strong>Method:</strong> Origin-Destination camera tracking at 30 key intersections</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What This Shows</h2>
    <p>This visualization displays vehicle routes observed during the traffic study. Each animated dot represents the path vehicles took through University Park. Routes are colored by volume:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong style="color:#bd0026;">Dark Red:</strong> High volume (>50 vehicles)</li>
        <li><strong style="color:#f03b20;">Red:</strong> Medium-high volume (21-50 vehicles)</li>
        <li><strong style="color:#fd8d3c;">Orange:</strong> Medium volume (11-20 vehicles)</li>
        <li><strong style="color:#feb24c;">Light Orange:</strong> Low volume (1-10 vehicles)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <div class="disclaimer">
        <p><strong>Purple Line Construction Impact:</strong> This data was collected during active Purple Line light rail construction in the area. Traffic patterns on Adelphi Road and surrounding streets may have been affected by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lane reductions on University Boulevard (MD 193)</li>
            <li>Turn restrictions at Adelphi Road intersections</li>
            <li>Drivers seeking alternate routes to avoid construction zones</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cut-through traffic volumes observed may be higher than normal conditions.</p>
    </div>

<div class="disclaimer">
    <p><strong>Route-Matching Methodology:</strong> This study tracks vehicles that complete entire predefined routes from entry to exit. Vehicles that stop mid-route (such as for school drop-off) or exit via a different path than they entered may not appear in the route counts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A parent entering the neighborhood, dropping a child at school, and exiting via a different intersection would not be captured as a complete route trip</li>
        <li>Only 3 vehicles were recorded on routes passing through both school corridor cameras (24 and 27), all in the afternoon</li>
        <li>Raw camera counts at individual intersections would provide a more complete picture of localized traffic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Traffic volumes near destinations like University Park Elementary may appear lower than actual vehicle activity at those locations.</p>
</div>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <p><strong>Single Day Sample:</strong> This data represents one Wednesday in April 2025. Traffic patterns may vary by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Day of week</li>
            <li>Season and school schedules</li>
            <li>Weather conditions</li>
            <li>Special events</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <p><strong>Visualization Accuracy:</strong> Intersection locations have been manually positioned to match the study map. Routes are shown as straight lines between intersections and do not follow actual road curves.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Study Goals</h2>
    <p>The University Park Traffic Calming Implementation Plan aims to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Improve traffic operations and reduce cut-through traffic</li>
        <li>Reduce vehicular speeding</li>
        <li>Improve walkability and bicycle mobility for residents and school children</li>
    </ol>

        <strong>This is not an official position.</strong> I am an AI enthusiast who thought it would be cool to code this up with Claude and Gemini CLIs on Christmas Day. So here is the webpage. As always, anything on this page does not have my employer's concurrence.
